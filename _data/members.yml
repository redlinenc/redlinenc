    Christa Hardman-Sudipo is from Charleston, West Virginia currently residing in Raleigh, NC.

    
    In 1998 she sang at her first professional wedding. From that point, Christa spent time in the studio writing her own original music detailing some of her own life experiences with her powerful and soulful vocals.Many artists have inspired Christa. She still remembers singing “Uptown Girl” by Billy Joel, while her mother filmed, at the age of six. As time went on, she developed an interest in all types of music, such as R&B, Classical, Latin, Rock and Jazz. Some of her favorite artists are Babyface, Mariah Carey, Steve Perry and P!nk. Of course, you cannot leave out Whitney Houston, for Christa’s childhood revolved around memorizing and singing every song that Whitney had ever made – for Whitney was her voice coach (via cassette tape). :)

    
    Through the years, Christa has been a vocalist in various cover bands around taking a break to have a family. From then until now, Christa continues to amaze everyone with the range and depth of her natural voice.

    Marty has always liked to hit things so it was only natural he start playing drums when he was nine, although he says he was never nine.


    While playing in jazz, marching, and concert bands, he was making his way in the world of rock… his real passion. His rock journey started by traveling up and down the East Coast in a controversial band called Knickers Down…and someone’s usually were! Since then has been in both original and cover bands in New York, South Carolina, and North Carolina.


    From 2008 to 2011 he provided the beat for the 2008 96ROCK house band winner…Reactor. He is now slamming out the beat for some of the hottest rock talent in North Carolina…REDLINE.

    Brian has been playing guitar since the age of 14 when he first heard Metallica.

  
    His taste in music expanded shortly after when his Dad introduced him to the work of The Allman Brothers Band, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Doobie Brothers and others. Brian played in a very popular cover/original band at Clemson University and then moved to Raleigh in 2005 where he helped start the original rock band Doc Murdoch and has played with several other local funk/rock/jam bands.


    His onstage energy and unpredictable “guitar playing” faces are sure to entertain as he rips up the stage with his new passion……Raleigh’s premier rock cover band REDLINE!

  bio: >
    Anthony was born on the bayou, in Lafayette, Louisiana.


    After cutting his musical teeth on a gumbo-like mix of Country, Blues, Swamp Pop, and Classic Rock, he moved to Nashville-—Music City USA—in 1995 where, instead of playing music himself, he proceeded to build a music-playing robot (rumors that this robot is now a member of the Black-Eyed Peas are TOTALLY false).


    Since moving to Raleigh in 2000, he has been in several local cover bands. Now he spends his time slapping the bass for Redline and yelling at the kids to get off his lawn.
