    Christa Hardman-Sudipo is from Charleston, West Virginia currently residing in Raleigh, NC.

    
    In 1998 she sang at her first professional wedding. From that point, Christa spent time in the studio writing her own original music detailing some of her own life experiences with her powerful and soulful vocals.Many artists have inspired Christa. She still remembers singing “Uptown Girl” by Billy Joel, while her mother filmed, at the age of six. As time went on, she developed an interest in all types of music, such as R&B, Classical, Latin, Rock and Jazz. Some of her favorite artists are Babyface, Mariah Carey, Steve Perry and P!nk. Of course, you cannot leave out Whitney Houston, for Christa’s childhood revolved around memorizing and singing every song that Whitney had ever made – for Whitney was her voice coach (via cassette tape). :)

    
    Through the years, Christa has been a vocalist in various cover bands around taking a break to have a family. From then until now, Christa continues to amaze everyone with the range and depth of her natural voice.

    Marty has always liked to hit things so it was only natural he start playing drums when he was nine, although he says he was never nine.


    While playing in jazz, marching, and concert bands, he was making his way in the world of rock… his real passion. His rock journey started by traveling up and down the East Coast in a controversial band called Knickers Down…and someone’s usually were! Since then has been in both original and cover bands in New York, South Carolina, and North Carolina.


    From 2008 to 2011 he provided the beat for the 2008 96ROCK house band winner…Reactor. He is now slamming out the beat for some of the hottest rock talent in North Carolina…REDLINE.

    Hugely inspired by Metallica, Danny picked up a guitar at the age of 13 in his native England. He formed the band Season's End and enjoyed national tours and press coverage at the tender age of 19. Danny then attended the Academy of Contemporary Music in Surrey where he pursued a degree in music production, and whilst studying, joined up with the million-selling UK pop production team Jiant, with whom he wrote and produced several successful international pop and dance music tracks. 
    
    
    Missing rock and roll and his guitar, Danny then formed female fronted alternative metal outfit The Mariana Hollow in 2008. Assuming the role of producer and co-writer, Danny and The Mariana Hollow made two critically-acclaimed, but unfortunately, widely unknown albums. From 2008-2012, Danny spent his time playing high-profile London venues, touring the UK and recording with the producers of Foo Fighters, Feeder and Skunk Anansie. Danny now says his point with The Mariana Hollow was seeing the band's video appear on the Europe-wide Kerrang! TV, albeit at 2am. Danny also played for four years with one of the UK's most in-demand, high-end wedding bands, Something Borrowed.


    Now settling with his wife in his adopted home of Raleigh, NC, Danny hopes to bring his dynamic guitar playing and musicality to Redline, and have a darn good time while he does it!

    Anthony was born on the bayou, in Lafayette, Louisiana.


    After cutting his musical teeth on a gumbo-like mix of Country, Blues, Swamp Pop, and Classic Rock, he moved to Nashville-—Music City USA—in 1995 where, instead of playing music himself, he proceeded to build a music-playing robot (rumors that this robot is now a member of the Black-Eyed Peas are TOTALLY false).


    Since moving to Raleigh in 2000, he has been in several local cover bands. Now he spends his time slapping the bass for Redline and yelling at the kids to get off his lawn.
