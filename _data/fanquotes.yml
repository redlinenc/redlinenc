  quote: The "New" Tony's Oyster Bar with Redline Band and freaking Christa Hardman Sudipo as their lead vocalist... she just really KILLED it tonight! I honestly don't know any other female vocalist in town that can hang like she can... she does ACDC then Heart then Pat Benetar, I'm just so impressed with her talent, and spunk and tenacity, AND the beautiful person that she is... inside and out.
