Raleigh's Premier Party Rock Band
=================================

Redline was formed in the fall of 2011 when some of Raleigh's most talented rock musicians from previous succesful cover projects joined forces. Redline specializes in playing high energy top 40 rock & roll tunes from the 70's, 80's, 90's and today's hits which are sure to keep people singing and dancing all night. The energy you will see from Redline is second to none as members are constantly jumping around the stage, interacting with other band mates and running out into the crowd and pulling people onto the stage who may be celebrating a special occasion.
 
Redline is available for any restaurant/club venue, corporate parties, weddings, and any other special occasion that will require fun rock and roll with a high energy twist. With cover choices ranging from The Rolling Stones to Guns N Roses and Journey all the way up to Pink and Beyonce, you are sure to go home fully satisfied from the amount of energy and talent poured into every Redline show. Come check us out at our next show and be ready to experience rock and roll music the way it was intended.....the REDLINE way!
