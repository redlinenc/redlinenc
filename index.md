The Triangle's Premier Party Rock Band
=================================

Redline was formed in the fall of 2011 when some of Raleigh’s most talented musicians from previous successful cover projects joined forces. Redline quickly became one of the Triangle’s most popular cover bands with the amazing and soulful lead female vocals of Christa. The energy you will see from Redline is second to none as each performance at each venue gets the party started immediately and everyone having a great time until the party must end.

Redline is available for any restaurant/club venue, corporate parties, weddings, and any other special occasion. With a variety of cover choices ranging from 80’s through today’s top 40, you are sure to go home fully satisfied from the amount of energy and talent poured into every Redline show. Come check us out at our next show and be ready to experience LIVE music the way it was intended…..the REDLINE way!
